# Jenkins YML Workflow

This is a pipeline library for Jenkins 2.x that allows execution to be defined in YML rather than in a Jenkinsfile.

## Requirements

* [Pipeline Shared Groovy Libraries](https://wiki.jenkins.io/display/JENKINS/Pipeline+Shared+Groovy+Libraries+Plugin)
* [Pipeline Remote Loader](https://wiki.jenkins.io/display/JENKINS/Pipeline+Remote+Loader+Plugin)

## Usage

This must be added as a global pipeline library in Jenkins.
